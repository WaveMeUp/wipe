Hi there! Here we have just a little Windows app to play with your RAM. I called it "Wipe" just because I like this word.
Created with Visual Studio 2013. Also, looks like it works properly only on x64 systems now.
Here you can download "cpp" and "h" files. Executable files can be downloaded here: http://wavemeup.me/wipe/

	- Select modes function
